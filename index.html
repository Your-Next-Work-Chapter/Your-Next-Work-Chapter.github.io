        Once upon a time, you began a career in your chosen profession and it
        felt so right. But now there's a plot twist.
      </h1>
      <p>
        Your sense of fulfillment and accomplishment isn't what it used to be.
      </p>
      <p>Maybe you're feeling a bit jaded, demotivated, or exhausted.</p>
      <p>
        Perhaps you're not getting as much joy out of your work as you did
        before.
      </p>
      <p>You're not alone in feeling these emotions.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>They're a natural part of the human experience.</li>
        <li>They're not a reflection of your capabilities and potential.</li>
        <li>
          And they're often a signal that you're ready to make some changes.

        Introducing <b>Your Next Work Chapter</b>, an AI-powered personal
        journey to find clarity and turn the page.
      </h1>
      <p>
        In just three self-paced online sessions, you'll apply a methodology
        rooted in behavioral science to recapture and further develop your:
      </p>
      <h2>Satisfaction</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          You want to <b>do work that's meaningful to you</b> beyond your
          paycheck.
        </li>
        <li>
          In your first session, you'll brainstorm and define a work purpose
          that aligns with your most deeply held values.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Strength</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          You want to be able to <b>stay motivated and confident</b> at work,
          even when you face obstacles.
        </li>
        <li>
          Any purpose worth pursuing has its challenges. In your second session,
          you'll learn and practice a life-changing technique to face barriers
          with resilience.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Success</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          You want to <b>grow and make progress</b> - in ways that matter to
          <i>you</i> and not just the people you report to.
        </li>
        <li>
          Aim your aspirations and energy toward your purpose and start making
          moves in that direction. In your final session, you'll learn some
          habits to build your momentum. You'll immediately be able to use
          them in everyday situations, and we'll provide a week of daily support.

        Continuing Studies. In my 5-week evening course, I teach evidence-based

        Many of my students enroll in this class because they’re seeking more
        joy in their <i>professional</i> lives. It’s not surprising given that
        most of us need to spend a significant portion of our waking hours
        working to support ourselves and our loved ones. Sadly, U.S. employee
        engagement has been on the decline for some time — and in 2024, it
        dropped to its lowest level in more than a decade.<a

        While I’m disheartened by this trend, I’m very encouraged by the impact
        my class has had on hundreds of students seeking change at all stages of
        life. It’s been gratifying to witness how they come away with more
        insight into what matters to them, as well as a plan and mindset to
        pursue it.

        As both a teacher and tech industry veteran, I see tremendous potential
        in the role AI can play in online learning and personal growth. Several
        of my graduates and teaching colleagues share my excitement. We've each
        gone through the process of reexamining and reshaping our professional
        lives, and want to help others do the same. Together, with a

        from America's Seed Fund powered by the NSF, we're introducing
        <i>Your Next Work Chapter</i> to bring the approach used in my class to
        anyone who wants more out of work, and by extension, life.
